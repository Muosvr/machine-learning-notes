[Lessons Learned Reproducing a Deep Reinforcement Learning Paper](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl). 

Reinforcement learning is hard because it's very hard to debug. Author rely on following confusion caused by small inconsistency to figure out what is wrong with his algorithum

Tips to save time
* experimenting a little and thinking a lot
* keeping a detailed work log
* taking the time to try and predict failure in advance: "How surprised would I be if this run failed?"

"reinforcement learning can be so unstable that you need to repeat every run multiple times with different seeds to be confident."
